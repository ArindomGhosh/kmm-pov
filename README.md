## What is KMM? :confused:
:point_right: **[KMM](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html)** is a framework developed and maintained by [jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) designed to share code across platforms primarily targeting: Android, iOS, Desktop, Web. So that the developers can share their modules developed in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) across different platform :heart_eyes:.

## How does it work and how its different from other Cross-Platform application? :monocle_face:
:point_right: First of all **KMM** is not a *Cross Platform* in a conventional sense :astonished:. KMM relies on [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) compiler to generate binaries for native platfoms using **Kotlin compiler backend** which could be called from **Native Platforms** :smirk:.\
In short don't re-invent the :wheel_of_dharma:, shareing as much as you can while developing your application using your native framework('s).\

## ðŸŽ¯ When to choose KMM ?

KMM is a new approach towards cross platform application development where it brings best of hybrid application's one code base, write once run anywhere principle
and also native application performance. As already mentioned above, most prominent usp of KMM is sharing common code across various platforms, which reduces duplicity and promotes building reusable components.
KMM (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile) is a technology that allows you to share code between different platforms, such as Android and iOS, in mobile app development. Here are some situations where choosing KMM for mobile app development might be beneficial:

ðŸ‘‰ Multi-target Apps: If you need to develop an app for both Android and iOS platforms, KMM can be a good choice. It allows you to write shared business logic and data access code in Kotlin, which can be used by both platforms, reducing code duplication and development efforts.

ðŸ‘‰ Code resusability/sharing: If you have complex business logic or data manipulation requirements that need to be consistent across platforms, KMM can help you share the codebase. By writing the code once in Kotlin and sharing it between platforms, you can ensure consistency and reduce the chances of bugs introduced due to platform-specific implementation differences.

ðŸ‘‰ Faster dev cycles: KMM can speed up the development process by enabling code reuse. Instead of building separate codebases for Android and iOS, you can write common code in Kotlin, reducing the time and effort required for development, testing, and maintenance.

ðŸ‘‰ Team efficiency: If you have a team of developers with expertise in <ins>Kotlin</ins>, adopting KMM can be advantageous. The team can leverage their existing Kotlin knowledge and skills to build mobile apps for both platforms, rather than learning and working with different programming languages.

ðŸ‘‰ Performance optimization: KMM allows you to optimize performance-critical parts of your app by writing platform-specific code in Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android. This way, you can achieve platform-specific optimizations while still sharing the majority of the code.

ðŸ‘‰ Maintainability: With KMM, code maintenance becomes easier as you have a single codebase to manage. Bug fixes, feature additions, and updates can be applied once, reducing the risk of inconsistencies between platforms and improving the overall maintainability of the codebase.

ðŸ’¡ <i>However, it's important to note that KMM might not be suitable for every app project. Consider the complexity of your app, platform-specific requirements, and the availability of third-party libraries and frameworks when deciding whether to choose KMM for mobile app development. Additionally, keep in mind that KMM is a relatively new technology, so it's essential to consider the maturity of the ecosystem and community support for your specific use case.</i>
